# bloodanalysisprototype

Simple example/prototype programs for GSoC project by Helikar Lab - Mobile-Based Blood-Sample Image Analysis software.

This repo currently has:

a) MedianFilter.java - A sample implementation of the classic median filter which can be used in step 2 for image pre-processing/noise reduction.  
b) IntensityMap.java - Though the project has to be accomplished in 3D (Calculating volumes) this program converts image to a colored intensity map in 2D.
